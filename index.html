          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p> I am a graduate from the University of Puerto Rico with ten years of military experience in the US Navy as a hospital corpsman. I have been on two deployments to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba serving the military population and guest population with high quality medical care. I have also demonstrated excellent clinical skill at seven different Naval medical facilities. I am versatile being fluent in English and Spanish. I am a meticulous student, since my military career I have had three years of nursing experience on cardiac floors and correctional facilities. For brevity only military experience is listed. I am currently working on transitioning to software engineering starting with a boot camp with the overall goal to complete a bachelors in computer science. </p>
